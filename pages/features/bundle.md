    Easily add sourcecode and resources via GitHub

---

We added an easy way to add sourcecode+resources via github without having to publish to a maven repository before. That's the new bundle system. We created an open catalog: <a href="https://awesome.korge.org/">awesome.korge.org</a> you can check the current bundles there and contribute with your own: <a href="https://github.com/korlibs/awesome.korge.org">github.com/korlibs/awesome.korge.org</a>

You can for example get CC0 assets from <a href="https://opengameart.org/">opengameart.org</a>, put them into a git repository and add code that gives semantics to those assets, helping the community. We plan to expose published bundles and resources directly into the IntelliJ plugin in future versions. Remember that even if the resources are CC0, it is always nice to give proper credit to the assert authors!
