Since KorGE targets the JVM, you can develop your game, try it, debug it and test it
using IntelliJ IDEA (including Community, Ultimate and Android Studio) integrated debugger.
And then deploy to the other targets by using the provided gradle tasks.

You can also use KorGE as a library and for example integrated it in your android-only project.
