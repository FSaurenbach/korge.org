description: KorGE Forge IDE offers an integrated store with free assets
---

We added an easy way to add sourcecode+resources via github without having to publish to a maven repository before. That's the new bundle system. We created an open catalog: <https://store.korge.org> you can check the current assets and modules there and contribute with your own: <https://github.com/korlibs/store.korge.org>

You can for example get CC0 assets from <a href="https://opengameart.org/">opengameart.org</a>, put them into a git repository and add code that gives semantics to those assets, helping the community. Exposed directly in the KorGE Forge IDE. Remember that even if the resources are CC0, it is always nice to give proper credit to the assert authors!
